Metric: Popularity
==================

Components from Github API:

* Stars (stargazers)
* Watchers
* Forks

Formula: ``stars + watchers + forks``


Explanation
-----------

Popularity does not imply anything directly about a community. But the size of the measurable popularity says something about the potential of a community and its responsibility.

It also helps understand threat vectors: The more popular something is, the more likely an attack vector it becomes. And the more sensitive it becomes if it's a library that serves as a dependency for others.

At this stage, let's not discuss how to make a project more or less popular. Let us just assume popularity as an objective number basis for creating other metrics.
